# 3D-Tube-Bender

The 3D Tube Bender project code base was created as part of my Senior Design project. The front end of runs off of WinForms which can be seen in the development photo below. The back end uses serial communication drivers controlled through C. 

## WinForms Development

Our goal was to create a user friendly control of the motors through intuitive UI controls with safety protections in place. We were able to abstract the serail communication codes all the way up to the user in the form of simple UI controls. The running UI can be seen in the photo below.
